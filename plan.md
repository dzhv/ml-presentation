- intro 
    Machine Learning model training basics
    Question for audience:
        how many of you have ever trained a ML model?

- MNIST problem
    you need to recognize hand written digits
    ML is the answer!

- ML model as a function
    what do we expect from the model?
        input -> image
        output -> digit


- Training
    show all data examples to the model
        that's why we iterate

    we need to say how good or bad was the guess
        that's why we need a loss function

    then for each guess we can find out how to slightly adjust any weight so that the loss would increase or decrease
        we try to adjust weights so that the loss decreases
        rinse and repeat

# Questions

- what dooes model function 10 vector array output mean?

- how many weights between inputs and first hidden layer?

- why is reducing training loss to zero a not sufficient idea?

- validation increases?
